# 🧬 Characterization of Biosynthetic Gene Clusters in *Helicobacter pylori*

This repository contains the code, annotations, analysis, and results for my MSc thesis project on biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in *Helicobacter pylori*, supervised by Prof. Kaisa Thorell at the University of Gothenburg.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

*Helicobacter pylori* is a gastric pathogen linked to ulcers and gastric cancer. Despite its clinical significance, the metabolic potential of its biosynthetic gene clusters remains understudied.

This project aims to:
- Annotate and catalog BGCs across >9000 *H. pylori* genomes using tools like antiSMASH and GECCO
- Compare BGC distribution across geographic populations
- Analyze associations between BGCs, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance using machine learning
