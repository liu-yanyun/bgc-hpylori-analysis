# 🧬 Thesis Project Plan: BGCs in *Helicobacter pylori*

## 🧑‍🔬 Supervisor:
Prof. Kaisa Thorell – University of Gothenburg

## 🧠 Project Summary
This project aims to identify and analyze biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in 9000+ *H. pylori* genomes using tools like antiSMASH and GECCO, and study their associations with virulence and antibiotic resistance.

## 📅 Timeline & Key Phases

### ✅ Phase 0: Setup (April)
- [x] Create GitHub repo and folder structure
- [x] Write PLAN.md and README.md
- [ ] Install/test antiSMASH and/or GECCO
- [ ] Review 2–3 key papers on BGCs in *H. pylori*

### 🔬 Phase 1: Annotation (May)
- [ ] Run antiSMASH/GECCO on a test genome
- [ ] Process batches of genomes
- [ ] Extract and store BGC metadata

### 🧬 Phase 2: Comparative + Phylogenetic Analysis (June)
- [ ] Cluster genomes based on BGC profile
- [ ] Map BGCs to population structure
- [ ] Visualize results with plots/trees

### 🤖 Phase 3: ML + Associations (July)
- [ ] Build classification models (e.g. RF, SVM)
- [ ] Predict virulence/AMR based on BGC presence
- [ ] Analyze feature importance

### 📝 Phase 4: Write-up + Review (August)
- [ ] Assemble final figures and summary stats
- [ ] Write thesis
- [ ] Prepare final GitHub version (with polished README and documentation)

## 🚧 Current Focus:
- Setting up the environment (April)
- Familiarizing with antiSMASH & GECCO
